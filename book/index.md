# Mercurial: the definitive guide (Third Edition)

This is a work in progress to get a new edition of the Mercurial book.

We welcome contributions to
[the Hgbook project on Github](https://github.com/paugier/mercurial-jupyterbook).

## About the previous editions

### First edition

The first edition of the book was authored by Bryan O'Sullivan and published by
O'Reilly in 2009. An HTML version of the book is
[available for free](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/).

### Second edition

Work on the second edition of the book was started in 2015 by Mathias De Mar√©. The
current version can be [read online](<>).

We, the Hgbook team, want to bring the book up-to-date and explain new concepts
and features that have been added to Mercurial in the past few years. Some of the
topics that have already been added are:

- Customizing the output of Mercurial through the use of **templates**,
- Changing history using **amend**, **rebase** and **histedit**,
- Scaling Mercurial for large repositories and user bases.
